These aspects include the kinetic properties of ribulose bisphosphate carboxylase-oxygenase; the requirements of the photosynthetic carbon reduction and photorespiratory carbon oxidation cycles for reduced pyridine nucleotides; the dependence of electron transport on photon flux and the presence of a temperature dependent upper limit to electron transport. The measurements of gas exchange with which the model outputs may be compared include those of the temperature and partial pressure of CO2(p(CO2)) dependencies of quantum yield, the variation of compensation point with temperature and partial pressure of O2(p(O2)), the dependence of net CO2 assimilation rate on p(CO2) and irradiance, and the influence of p(CO2) and irradiance on the temperature dependence of assimilation rate.},

  abstract =  { AbstractScaleX is a collaborative measurement campaign, collocated with a long-term environmental observatory of the German Terrestrial Environmental Observatories (TERENO) network in the mountainous terrain of the Bavarian Prealps, Germany. The aims of both TERENO and ScaleX include the measurement and modeling of land surface–atmosphere interactions of energy, water, and greenhouse gases. ScaleX is motivated by the recognition that long-term intensive observational research over years or decades must be based on well-proven, mostly automated measurement systems, concentrated in a small number of locations. In contrast, short-term intensive campaigns offer the opportunity to assess spatial distributions and gradients by concentrated instrument deployments, and by mobile sensors (ground and/or airborne) to obtain transects and three-dimensional patterns of atmospheric, surface, or soil variables and processes. Moreover, intensive campaigns are ideal proving grounds for innovative instruments, methods, and techniques to measure quantities that cannot (yet) be automated or deployed over long time periods. ScaleX is distinctive in its design, which combines the benefits of a long-term environmental-monitoring approach (TERENO) with the versatility and innovative power of a series of intensive campaigns, to bridge across a wide span of spatial and temporal scales. This contribution presents the concept and first data products of ScaleX-2015, which occurred in June–July 2015. The second installment of ScaleX took place in summer 2016 and periodic further ScaleX campaigns are planned throughout the lifetime of TERENO. This paper calls for collaboration in future ScaleX campaigns or to use our data in modelling studies. It is also an invitation to emulate the ScaleX concept at other long-term observatories. },

  abstract =  {The estimation of carbon exchange between ecosystems and the atmosphere
	suffers unavoidable data gaps in eddy-covariance technique, especially
	for short-living and fast-growing croplands. In this study we developed
	a modified gap-filling scheme introducing a leaf area index factor
	as the vegetation status information based on the conventional light
	response function for two East-Asian cropland sites (rice and potatoes).
	This scheme's performance is comparable to the conventional time
	window scheme, but has the advantage when the gaps are large compared
	to the total length of the time series. To investigate how the time
	binning approach performs for fast-growing croplands, we tested different
	widths of the time window, showing that a four-day window for the
	potato field and an eight-day time window for the rice field perform
	the best. The insufficiency of the conventional temperature binning
	approach was explained as well as the influence of vapor pressure
	deficit. We found that vapor pressure deficit plays a minor role
	in both the potato and the rice fields under Asian monsoon weather
	conditions with the exception of the early pre-monsoon growing stage
	of the potatoes. Consequently, we recommend using the conventional
	time-window scheme together with our new leaf-light response function
	to fill data gaps of net ecosystem exchange in fast-growing croplands.},
